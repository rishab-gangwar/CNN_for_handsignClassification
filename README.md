# numbers_on_hand_sign
this project is on building a cnn model  for classifying numbers which are represented by hand signs
in **tensorflow 1.2.1**.*this notebook is inspired by andrew ng's deep learning course*
things done apart from completing the course assignment:
1. each cell/function/file was written again with efficient coding and less comments.
2. hyper-parameter tuning was done.
3. as model in course assignment was overfiting and had max val accuracy of 78%
4. I inc. **l.r. and epochs** so that its final val accuracy was 90%+
