# numbers_on_hand_sign
this project is on building a cnn model  for classifying numbers in tensorflow 1.2.1.
it is inspired by andrew ng's deep learning course:
1. each cell/function/file was written again with efficient coding.
2. hyper-parameter tuning was done by my-self.
3. assignment model was overfiting and had max val accuracy of 78%
4. I inc. **l.r. and epochs** its final val accuracy was 90%+
